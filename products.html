        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        </center>
        <p class="element-class">The problem we face is the unnecessary waste created by littering. Everywhere
            you look you see litter in one form or another. For example, you can find hundreds of cigarette butts
            on the ground. You can see small pieces of waste on the side walks. This garbage and waste make people
            feel uncomfortable and want to stay outside. Many people have tried to solve this problem through things
            like public waste bins (recycling bins, garbage bins, compost bins), picking up litter, and reusing products. Unfortunately,
            public waste bins are not everywhere and it still leaves space for people to litter. When picking up litter
            you may be discouraged by the effort it takes, some may even be disgusted by the litter. Also many people
            don't think about reusing products like coffee cups and plastic waste and end up dropping it. We
            want to solve this problem and keep our cities as clean as possible.
